## Set up

* **Repo setup**: Follow the setup in [Test-Driven Tuesday repository setup](https://github.com/jan-molak/test-driven-tuesday#workshop-setup) :-)
* **Get dependencies**: Run `npm install` (make sure you have [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) installed! )
* **Validate**: run `npm test`

Now you can `git pull` from origin and `git push` to your fork without verbose commands like `git pull origin master`

## Feeling Lucky?

Run `node pick_one` and enjoy your random kata!
